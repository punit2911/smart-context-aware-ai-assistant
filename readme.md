# Smart Context-Aware AI Assistant (Backend)

Welcome to the **Smart Context-Aware AI Assistant**! This project provides the backend API for an AI-powered assistant that can process user messages, generate responses, and remember context over time. The backend is built using **FastAPI**, **Pydantic**, and **Transformers** for seamless integration with NLP models like GPT-2.

## üöÄ Features

- **Context-Aware Messaging**: The assistant can remember past messages and generate responses based on the conversation context.
- **AI Chatbot**: Powered by advanced language models from **Hugging Face's Transformers** library.
- **Memory Integration**: Maintains conversation history and allows the assistant to provide more coherent responses by recalling previous interactions.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Fast API server using **WebSockets** or HTTP requests for a dynamic user experience.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and parsing through Python type annotations.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Pre-trained deep learning models for natural language processing tasks.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **Python 3.12+**

## üì¶ Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/punit2911/smart-context-aware-ai-assistant.git

cd smart-context-aware-ai-assista

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

- **Set up Virtual Environment**:
    - **Windows**:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **macOS/Linux**:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

- **Install Required Dependencies**:

  Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Run the Server

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

By default, the API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üåê API Endpoints

Here are the primary API endpoints available:

### `POST /api/chat/send`

Sends a message to the AI assistant and receives a generated response.

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, how are you?"
}
```

#### Response:

```json
{
  "response": "I'm doing great, thank you for asking!"
}
```

### `GET /api/chat/history`

Returns the conversation history (i.e., messages exchanged with the AI assistant).

#### Response:

```json
[
  {
    "user_message": "Hello",
    "bot_response": "Hi! How can I help you today?"
  },
  {
    "user_message": "What's the weather like?",
    "bot_response": "I don't know, but I can help with a lot of other things!"
  }
]
```

## üîÑ Conversation Memory

The assistant maintains a memory of all user interactions. This memory allows the assistant to provide more contextually relevant responses as the conversation progresses. It ensures that the AI assistant isn't just a sequence of isolated requests but a continuous, intelligent conversation partner.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Usage

You can test the API by using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.

### Example with cURL:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/chat/send' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "message": "How are you?"
}'
```

### Example with Python:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000/api/chat/send"
data = {"message": "What is the capital of France?"}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Structure

- **`app/`**: Contains the main FastAPI application code.
  - **`main.py`**: Entry point for the FastAPI application.
  - **`api/`**: Contains API-related logic, such as message handling and memory.
    - **`chat.py`**: Handles sending messages and generating responses.
    - **`memory.py`**: Manages the memory and conversation history.

## üåç Deployment

To deploy this project in production, you can use **Docker**, **Heroku**, or any other cloud platform of your choice.

1. **Dockerize the Application**

To build a Docker image for the application:

```bash
docker build -t smart-context-aware-ai-assistant .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 smart-context-aware-ai-assistant
```

3. **Deploy to Heroku**

Ensure you have a `Procfile` in the root of your project with the following content:

```
web: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}
```

Then follow the Heroku deployment steps for FastAPI.
